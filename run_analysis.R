Enter file contents here## From problem description: 
## You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.  
## 
## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
## Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
## 
##From the submission instructions: 
## Please upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE 
## (do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission). 
 
 
## We begin by putting the script in the same directory where we have the dataset directory 
## (One level up from the actual data files, like features.txt) 

 
## Using R 3.1.1 
 
 
library("reshape2") 

 
## Step 1-1: 
## READ ALL THE DATA!! 

 
## basedir <- "UCI HAR Dataset/" 
activity_labels <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt") 
 
 
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt") ## 561 obs of 2 vars, rownums incl 
features <- features[2] ## simplify, cut row numbers 
features <- as.vector(features[,1]) ## it works, but not pretty. 
 
 
x_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", colClasses = c("numeric"), col.names = features) ## 2947 obs of 561 vars 
y_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt") ## 2947 obs of 1 var 
subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt") ## 2947 obs of 1 v 

 
## take only the columns we want 
x_test <- x_test[c(201, 202, 214, 215, 227, 228, 240, 241, 253, 254, 503, 504, 516, 517, 529, 530, 542, 543)]

x_test$activity <- as.factor(x_test$activity) 
x_test[, "subject"] <- subject_test 
x_test$subject <- as.factor(x_test$subject) 

 
## Ugly but it will do 
x_test$activity_labels <- x_test$activity 
x_test$activity_labels <- factor(x_test$activity_labels, levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 
                                 labels = c("WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS",

## Step 1-2: 
## merge all data, free up memory 

 
all_data <- rbind(x_test, x_train) 
#  
rm(subject_test) 
rm(x_test) 
rm(y_test) 
rm(subject_train) 
rm(x_train) 
rm(y_train) 
rm(features) 
 
 
#Perform the aggregation on the combined dataset, ignore errors... probably messed something up. 
agg_all <- aggregate(all_data, by= list(all_data$activity_labels, all_data$subject), FUN = mean, na.rm = FALSE) 

 
#write the file out. 
write.table(agg_all, file="tidy_HCI_data.txt", col.names=TRUE)
